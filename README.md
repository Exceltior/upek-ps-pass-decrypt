UPEK Protector Suite Password Decrypter

This is a little .NET 2.0 C# console application that demonstrates how to decrypt Windows logon credentials from registry keys created by UPEK (now AuthenTec)'s Protector Suite software.

Run it with "-h" to see how to use it. By default it spits out all the Windows usernames, passwords, and domains it can find, but you can specify everything with verbose mode (-v).

If this tool doesn't work for you and you want it to, feel free to let me know at brandonlw@gmail.com along with a sample of your data so support can be added.
